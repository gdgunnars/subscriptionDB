# subscriptionDB
A small database and simple bootstrap site to handle subscriptions for a local boxing gym
---
**Notice:**
The code is being re-written from scratch as an flask API.
Checkin site will be updated with new API, but the old admin site will not work if updated straight away with the api. I recommend running the API alongside the old backend.
There will be updated admin section, but it will not roll out straight away.
