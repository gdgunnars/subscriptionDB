# subscriptionDB
A small database and simple bootstrap site to handle subscriptions for a local boxing gym

**Notice:**
The code is being re-written from scratch as an flask API.

Checkin site will be updated to work with new API, but the old admin site won't work if old backend is removed. I recommend running the API alongside the old backend and remove it when the new admin section will be available.
